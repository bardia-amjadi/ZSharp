## 🚀 Why Z#?

- **Direct Execution** – No AST, no intermediate compilation; your code runs exactly as written.  
- **Ultimate Flexibility** – Manage variables, arrays, and functions dynamically.  
- **High Performance** – Optimized for speed-critical commercial applications.  
- **Developer-Centric** – Fine-tune every aspect of execution for your specific needs.

## ⚙️ Powered by NoAST  

**NoAST** is Z#’s unique core technology.  
Unlike traditional languages that rely on an **Abstract Syntax Tree**, Z# interprets and executes your code **immediately**, giving:  

- Faster runtime behavior  
- Lower memory overhead  
- Precise developer control  
- Simplified optimization without compiler interference
